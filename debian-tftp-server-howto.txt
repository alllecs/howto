    sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp

    Create /etc/xinetd.d/tftp and put this entry

    service tftp
    {
    protocol        = udp
    port            = 69
    socket_type     = dgram
    wait            = yes
    user            = nobody
    server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
    server_args     = /tftpboot
    disable         = no
    }

    Create a folder /tftpboot this should match whatever you gave in server_args. mostly it will be tftpboot

    sudo mkdir /tftpboot
    sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot
    sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot

    Restart the xinetd service.

    newer systems:

    sudo service xinetd restart

    older systems:

    sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart

Now our tftp server is up and running.
Testing our tftp server

    Create a file named test with some content in /tftpboot path of the tftp server

    Obtain the ip address of the tftp server using ifconfig command

    Now in some other system follow the following steps.

    tftp 192.168.1.2
    tftp> get test
    Sent 159 bytes in 0.0 seconds

    tftp> quit

    cat test
